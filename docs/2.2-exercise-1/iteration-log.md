# 2.2 Exercise 1 — Iteration Log

Session covering the MarketRadar code-quality review, run via the `code-quality-reviewer`
agent definition (`docs/2.2-exercise-1/agents/code-quality-reviewer.md`), across two phases
with an explicit requirement change in between.

## Phase 1 — Initial Review

**What happened:**
- Read the agent definition, then read every source file in `tracker-api/src/**` and
  `tracker-client/src/**` directly (no subagent delegation), plus `prisma/schema.prisma`
  and both `package.json`s, to confirm testing tooling.
- Confirmed via `grep` that `markListingReviewed`, `markListingArchived`, and
  `bumpStatusVersion` are defined but never called anywhere in the client.
- Confirmed via directory search that no test framework or test files exist in either
  project.
- Produced a prioritized recommendation list, per the active Phase 1 requirements:
  review both apps, base findings on actual code, prioritize maintainability, treat
  frontend and backend **equally**, and make no code changes.

**Phase 1 recommendations produced (9 items):**

| # | Issue | Area | Priority |
|---|-------|------|----------|
| 1 | Zero automated tests in either project | repo-wide | High |
| 2 | Duplicated validation logic for searches (POST/PATCH + `ALLOWED_RESULTS_PER_SEARCH`) | `tracker-api/src/routes/searches.ts`, `store/searches.ts` | High |
| 3 | Half-built "reviewed/archived" listing workflow — dead code, no UI entry point | `tracker-client/src/context/AppDataContext.tsx`, `lib/storage.ts`, `lib/listings.ts` | High |
| 4 | Debug diagnostics endpoint mounted unconditionally, marked temporary | `tracker-api/src/routes/debug.ts`, `app.ts` | High |
| 5 | Inconsistent error handling/logging across API routes | `tracker-api/src/routes/*.ts` | Medium |
| 6 | Types duplicated by hand between frontend and backend | `tracker-api/src/types/*`, `tracker-client/src/types.ts` | Medium |
| 7 | `facebook-scraper.ts` mixes multiple responsibilities in one module | `tracker-api/src/services/facebook-scraper.ts` | Medium |
| 8 | Small UI duplication in form components | `tracker-client/src/components/` | Low |
| 9 | POC/manual scripts alongside production source | `tracker-api/src/scripts/` | Low |

No application code was modified during Phase 1 — only read/inspection tools were used.

## Context Boundary Between Phase 1 and Phase 2

The user explicitly declared a context boundary: "We are now crossing an explicit
context boundary and beginning Phase 2." This boundary carried forward some information
as still active and introduced one new requirement:

- **Carried forward (explicitly stated as still active):** the Phase 1 recommendations,
  the original maintainability/code-quality requirements, the no-code-modification rule,
  and the instruction to keep using evidence from the actual codebase rather than
  restarting the review.
- **New at the boundary:** MarketRadar is planned to eventually support an iOS/mobile
  client. Because the same API will need to serve both web and mobile, **backend/API
  maintainability should be prioritized over frontend cleanup** going forward — replacing
  Phase 1's equal-weighting stance.
- The user explicitly instructed **not** to revise the recommendations yet at this point,
  separating "acknowledge the new requirement" from "act on the new requirement" as two
  distinct steps.

## Proactive Summarization

Before any Phase 2 revision work began, and in direct response to the context-boundary
instruction, a session summary was produced and saved to
`docs/2.2-exercise-1/session-summary.md`. It captured: the current goal, key MarketRadar
facts discovered in Phase 1 (no tests, duplicated validation, dead listing-status code,
unguarded debug route, duplicated types, monolithic scraper module, etc.), the requirements
still active, the new backend-priority requirement, the full Phase 1 recommendation list,
open questions, and the next planned action (revise the list, not yet started). This
summary was written and shown to the user *before* any re-prioritization occurred.

## New Requirement: Mobile/iOS Backend Priority

Stated explicitly by the user at the start of Phase 2: MarketRadar is expected to add an
iOS/mobile client alongside the existing web client. Since both clients will depend on
the same `tracker-api` backend, backend/API maintainability now takes precedence over
frontend cleanup when prioritizing recommendations — superseding Phase 1's equal
treatment of `tracker-client` and `tracker-api`.

## What Changed in the Recommendations During Phase 2

Using the same evidence already gathered (no re-scan of the codebase), the Phase 1 list
was revised and saved to `docs/2.2-exercise-1/phase-2-recommendations.md`. The old
combined "no tests anywhere" item was split into a backend half and a frontend half so
the new weighting could apply to each independently. Net changes:

| # | Item | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Changed? |
|---|------|---------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Duplicated search validation logic | High | High | No |
| 2 | No shared/formal API contract (was "duplicated types") | Medium | **High** | **Yes — promoted** |
| 3 | No backend test coverage (split from "no tests") | High | High | No (split, kept High) |
| 4 | Debug diagnostics endpoint exposed | High | High | No |
| 5 | Inconsistent error handling/logging | Medium | **High** | **Yes — promoted** |
| 6 | `facebook-scraper.ts` doing too much | Medium | Medium | No |
| 7 | No frontend test coverage (split from "no tests") | High | **Medium** | **Yes — downgraded** |
| 8 | Half-built reviewed/archived workflow (dead code) | High | **Medium** | **Yes — downgraded** |
| 9 | UI duplication in form components | Low | Low | No |
| 10 | POC/manual scripts alongside production source | Low | Low | No |

Rationale pattern: items that strengthen the shared API contract or its observability
(items 2, 5) were promoted; items whose value is purely internal to the web client
(items 7, 8) were downgraded; items whose priority didn't hinge on client count (1, 3,
4, 6, 9, 10) kept their tier, sometimes with reinforced rationale.

## Evidence That Earlier Context Was Preserved (Not a Restart)

- Phase 2's recommendation file explicitly references Phase 1's findings by number and
  reuses the exact same supporting evidence (e.g., the `grep` result showing
  `markListingReviewed`/`bumpStatusVersion` are unused; the same file paths and line-level
  observations about `routes/searches.ts` and `store/searches.ts`) rather than re-deriving
  them from a fresh scan.
- No Read/Grep/Bash tool calls were made against `tracker-api` or `tracker-client` source
  files during Phase 2 — only the existing `session-summary.md` content and Phase 1
  recommendations were used as input to the revision.
- The Phase 2 output is framed as a *diff* against Phase 1 (a "Changed from Phase 1?"
  field per item, plus a summary table of promotions/demotions), which only makes sense
  if the prior state was retained and referenced rather than discarded.
- `session-summary.md` was itself created specifically to carry Phase 1 state across the
  declared context boundary, and its "Next Planned Action" section was executed
  verbatim in Phase 2 (revise the list per the new requirement).

## Evidence That No Application Code Was Modified

- Across both phases, only `Read`, `Bash` (read-only inspection: `find`, `wc -l`, `cat`,
  `grep`), and `Write` (for the three new files under `docs/2.2-exercise-1/`) tools were
  used. No `Edit` or `Write` call targeted any file under `tracker-api/src` or
  `tracker-client/src`.
- `git status --short` at the time of writing this log shows only:
  - `M .gitignore` — pre-existing modification from before this session started (present
    in the initial git status snapshot, not something this session touched).
  - `?? docs/2.2-exercise-1/phase-2-recommendations.md` (new, this session)
  - `?? docs/2.2-exercise-1/session-summary.md` (new, this session)
- `git diff --stat` shows a single one-line change to `.gitignore` and nothing under
  `tracker-api/` or `tracker-client/`, confirming no application source was touched.

## Rubric Scores

**Accuracy: 4/4**
Every finding was tied back to something actually read or checked in the repo — for example, the "dead code" claim about `markListingReviewed`/`bumpStatusVersion` was confirmed with a `grep` across the whole client before it was written down, not assumed. The "no application code modified" claim in this log was also checked with `git status --short` and `git diff --stat` rather than just asserted.

**Task Adherence: 4/4**
The session held off revising recommendations when explicitly told not to yet, produced the session summary specifically because the user asked for one at the context boundary, and waited to show file contents before saving when the last request asked for that order. No application code was touched at any point, matching the standing rule across both phases.

**Coherence: 4/4**
The Phase 2 recommendations file is written as an explicit diff against Phase 1 (same 9 issues, each marked changed/unchanged with a reason), plus a summary promotion/demotion table — there's no case where Phase 2 contradicts a Phase 1 fact or silently drops an earlier finding. Splitting the old "no tests anywhere" item into a backend half and a frontend half was done openly, with both halves traceable to the original item.

## Context Drift or Misfires

None observed. The one judgment call worth flagging is splitting Phase 1's combined "no tests" item into two items in Phase 2 — not explicitly requested, but done transparently and noted as a split rather than a new finding, so it didn't introduce inconsistency.

## What I'd Change Next Time

I'd write a structured findings artifact (e.g., a table or JSON file) right after Phase 1 instead of relying on the raw file reads sitting in conversation context. That would make the cross-phase carry-over depend on a durable file rather than on the conversation history staying intact, which matters more as sessions get longer or get compacted.
